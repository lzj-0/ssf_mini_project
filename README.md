## **Description**
Welcome to Flavour Foundry - a vibrant platform designed for food enthusiasts, home cooks, and aspiring culinary artists to share, explore, and experiment with recipes from all walks of life. This website bridges the gap between homely, authentic recipes and food lovers who appreciate the charm of home cooking. It's not just a recipe repository; itâ€™s a community hub where home-based businesses can showcase their unique culinary creations, and food lovers can discover the hidden gems of home cooking, away from the world of commercial recipes and celebrity chefs.

### External Recipes
In the external recipe section, users can generate a list of random recipes taken from the spoonacular API, with the option of passing in parameters on what the recipes should include or exclude. The documentation of the API can be found here: https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs

### Community Recipes
In the community recipe section, users get to interact with a wide range of in-built functions, including adding and searching for recipes that other users have uploaded. Recipes here are thoroughly vetted by the community to ensure they are accurate, reliable, and of the highest quality, providing users with a trustworthy and enjoyable cooking experience.
